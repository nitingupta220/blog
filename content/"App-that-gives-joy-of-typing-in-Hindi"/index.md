> Nowadays when you get up in morning what is the first thing you do? The first thing that I do is checking my **WhatsApp**. And I thought many of you will also do this. Everyone has curiousness to know who messages them and what messages are they receive from any particular person. This curiousness is very obvious. WhatsApp is very useful to us. He gives us the platform to talk to anyone who is far from us. And WhatsApp is daily adding new features to his app. Like its new feature that you can now share your status not only in text but also in images.  
> Sometimes it feels like WhatsApp is more interesting when it is your regional language or the language you are familiar to. Because message in your regional language attaches many emotions with it. But unfortunately, WhatsApp is not giving this feature now for sure.   
> To simplify lives of those who wish to communicate in regional languages using their smartphones, the Industrial Design Centre (IDC) in Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) has designed **Swarachakra**.  
> Swarachakra is available free of cost to all android users. Swarachakra is a keyboard app that let you type in your regional languages like Hindi, Marathi, Konkani, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Oriya, Bengali, Assamese, Punjabi and Gujarati.  
> The uniqueness of the dynamic keyboard lies in the way it keeps the structure of Indian scripts in mind. While a typical keyboard is designed for the alphabet and thus does not recognize the typicalities of the Indian scripts, Swarachakra stands apart due to the fact that it doesn’t use the alphabet as the basis for its application.  
> I recommend you to use it. And after using that you will feel very joyful in typing in your regional language.
