If you are living in **Delhi**, there are many chances that you heard about a man called **“Medicine Baba”**. The man is a true inspiration that if you want to do something there is always a way to do that thing. His story is very motivating, he is a retired blood bank technician from Noida’s Kailash Hospital. One day he is passing by a construction building, suddenly the building collapsed and there are deaths of few people and several injured. Then he observes the victims carefully and found that they have no money to buy the medicine or to go to a doctor. This incident motivates him to start the chain of going door to door and asking unused and expired medicines so, that he can start his supply chain.   
He also observes that affording healthcare facilities in a government hospital have become a costly affair. So those who don’t have enough money to buy the medicines then “Medicine Baba” is their messiah. He daily collects thousands of medicines by the end of the day. He has medicinal products for almost all diseases like typhoid, jaundice, malaria etc.   
He has so many medicines now that there is no place to keep him at his home. So he asks some help from the government to give them a storage to keep their medicine at that place and provide the needy person for free 24/7 because of all the government dispensaries closed by 4:30 pm. Almost eight months have passed, and he still trying to get a place.  
But despite all that government issue he still helping the people. Now people also appreciate his work and they also call him if they had some unused medicines. Also, they support him financially.  
He is a true inspiration for many.
