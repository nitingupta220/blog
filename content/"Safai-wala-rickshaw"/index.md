Read about **Sachin,** an auto driver from **Delhi** who has on a agenda to clean the city.When he started to drive an autorickshaw he observed that people eat something and throw the trash on the road or in his rickshaw. So,he fitted a trash bin to the back of his auto for the peoples who travel by his auto and told them to use the dustbin and make the city clean. He also has a super offer for their passengers that he told them if they respect women and help in to make the city clean, he gives a free ride to them. I appreciated his initiative and respect him for that. By inspiring from his work, I also started to make the surroundings clean and my view has changed that if anyone wants change in society then, first of all he has to change himself.
