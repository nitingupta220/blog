You often see that many people got ill due to drinking contaminated water. And in rural areas, you see that they have no access to clean drinking water. They drink water that comes from hand pumps and fall ill. So what is the solution to that problem? One solution that comes to my mind that we have to drink purified water. But when you travel you either take one or two bottles of purified water. So one thing you do is that take the purifier with you. Now you laugh at my words. But boss I am serious about that. You actually take the purifier with you. Now you thought that I am going mad. No, no my friends I am not mad but you are going to crazy after hearing this story.   
A student from Karnataka, **Niranjan Karagi** who is pursuing 3rd year in engineering has developed an affordable water purifier. He named it “**Nirnal**”. It is very handy and portable, you actually take it with you while traveling. So the question is that how we use it. It’s use is very simple just fill the water into the bottle and insert the purifier. Shake the bottle a bit, and the water is ready to drink. It’s very handy and can fit into the small bottles also.   
So how do he get the idea? He tells that he got the idea of developing this purifier by the school children. He said that there’s a school near his house and he often goes there to play with children. And there he observes that many children fall ill after drinking unsuitable water from the tanks in the school which was very dirty from inside. For this, he searches for the different alternatives on the internet. After lots of effort, he finally decided to make the purifier himself. It only takes cotton, activated carbon and mesh in a plastic covering. The manufacturing process did not incur much. For manufacturing, he hired three women and taught them the manufacturing process. They give them orders and after the manufacturing he pays them.   
He started selling it in 2016, and so far he sold 8000 units. He received orders from different parts of the world. Anyone who is above 5-years can use it. It is beneficial for school going children and people who love to travel can take this with him. It is very compatible, portable and eco-friendly.   
He wants this purifier to reach where people has no access to clean drinking water. His initiative is very good.
