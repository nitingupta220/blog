This year’s **Republic day** is very special in many ways. Like this year my favorite sportsperson **Virat Kohli** (plays cricket for Indian national team) received the **Padma** award. On this occasion, everywhere throughout the nation Our **Prime Minister**, **President** and many collectors were hoisting the flags in different programs, functions and other places. But this year on Republic day a beautiful gesture happened in a small village in **Madhya Pradesh**. A brilliant initiative was taken by the town incharge who called a sweeper to hoist the flag. At first, the sweeper was not ready to hoist the flag but when the town incharge and all the officials forced him, he did it. He has moved to tears by this beautiful gesture.   
The sweeper’s name was **Dinesh Bawre**, a 55-years old man who used to clean the roads of his town on a daily basis. After this incident, TI **Anil Sharma** said, “These sweepers are work very hard to clean the environment. Prime Minister **Narendra Modi** is putting so much effort in S**wach Bharat Abhiyaan**. For this, he felt that these workers should be honored. It is a matter of pride to hoist a flag.  
Dinesh Bawre works as a sweeper in Municipal Corporation and comes every morning to clean the roads. He has been working for past 40 years. Everybody was happy after that incident.  
It is really a good initiative because these workers are very hard working persons but their hard work overshadows by the senior officials. But this incident proves that there are some persons who really value these types of people.  
I salute Anil Sharma for this thing. We all have to take such initiative to encourage those people who work for the society.
