You know that on the occasion of **Republic day**, Govt. give **Padma awards** to some people who is great in their fields. This year the Padma awards are being given to the **“unsung heroes”** of the country. Our dear **Virat Kohli** received the Padma this year. He received this for his great achievements in cricket. And like Virat, many of the sports person received the Padma this year. The list includes our Rio Olympic Silver medalist **PV Sindhu**, another Rio medalist, **Sakshi Malik**, **P Gopichand** and many more like them. There is one more person who received the Padma this year. He is our **Bike-Ambulance-Dada,** **Karimul Haque**. Now, most of you don’t know that who is Kairmul Haque and why I call him Bike-Ambulance-Dada.   
So let me tell you that Karimul is a normal person who spends in his daily life by doing a job in a tea farm. And now you ask me why Govt. give him the Padma if he is not doing anything great. Just hold on guys, now I tell you that he has run an ambulance service in some districts in West Bengal. And this time you would laugh at me and on Govt. that why Govt. give him the Padma for this normal work and why I tell you about him.   
Let me tell you that his ambulance service is not a normal ambulance. 50-year-old Karimul Haque is the ‘Bike-Ambulance-Dada’ for the people of Dhalabari Village in Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal. The tea estate worker has become a ray of hope to the villagers.   
Not only his own, but Karimul also has become the savior of people in 20 villages where there are no concrete roads, electricity, mobile towers, and other basic amenities. And Hospital is also 45 kilometers away from them.   
Many years ago, when his mother was sick he went door-to-door for help. He is unable to find any ambulance service and by the lack of medical attention, his mother passed away. After that incident, he decided that he never let anyone dies due to lack of ambulance facilities.  
But the idea of using the bike as an ambulance came some years later when his co-worker collapsed in the working field. He tied his friend to the back and take him to the nearest hospital. Then his friend received medical attention and slowly regained his health. After this incident, Karimul bike ambulance became a full-fledged idea and service.   
And not only bike ambulance but Karimul also provides basic first aid facilities to the villagers after learning these things from local doctors. He also runs health campaign in many villages.  
He earns a very low amount of Rs.4000 but despite all the challenges, he never fails to help any patient.   
He dreams to bring an advanced ambulance to his village equipped with all the necessary facilities.  
I salute this man and hope that he succeeds in fulfilling his dreams.  
And now you understand why I say that this year’s Padma awards are given to the unsung heroes.
