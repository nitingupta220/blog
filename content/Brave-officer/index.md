Imagine at a night your doorbell rings and when you open the door there are two policemen standing outside your home. What is the feeling you have at that time? Personally, I feel very scared and started to ask many random questions. But what if they only want some water or some general information. It doesn’t happen yet but what if they actually came for this. But by the name of police and police inspector everyone afraid. There are many misperceptions about police officers. Because in movies and television we all see a police officer is either corrupt or bad. And we have an image in our mind that police officers are only corrupt and bad. There are many stereotypes associated with the profession of police. But we all know that not all the police officers are bad, there are some police officers who actually work for the society. I know an incident when a police officer risks his life to save people.   
In a small village of UP, an incident happens when a car hit by a truck and the family members inside in it fell into a sewer which has chemical waste. There are many people but no one has the courage to help them. But a policeman named **Sanjeev Kumar**, who is passing by saw this incident and when he knows there is someone who got stuck in the sewer. He didn’t think twice and jumps into the sewer to help them.   
This gesture of this policeman will reinforce your belief in the profession. After the incident when everyone asked him he said,”There is no special thing he has done. It is his duty to help them. He didn’t do anything of that sort.”   
These words are very precious, he didn’t even want appreciation for this. I hope there are many policemen who are like him. So, for now, I changed my views for them.
