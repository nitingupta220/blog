Many times you have to move to another city whether for your studies or for a job. Many times people travel to Metropolitan cities for better opportunities. And they face many problems when moving to the new city like finding a house, adjusting the local food, adapting to the temperature of that city and making new friends. All the problems are faced by the people who moves to the new city. But the major problem that everyone faces is to finding a house for them. If you never move to a new city then you might think that this is not a big task to find a house. But let me tell you that it is a huge task for anyone to find a house in a new city. The task is hard because the landlords have many conditions for their tenants like many times they ask for the higher rent, they want their tenants to keep the room clean, they want pure vegetarian and sometimes they want to give their room rent to those people who are married. It means that if you want to take a room for rent in a city then you must have married. There are more problems like the people want to give their rooms for rent to a specific religion.   
According to a survey, Pune is declared the easiest city to settle down and Hyderabad is the most women-friendly city.
