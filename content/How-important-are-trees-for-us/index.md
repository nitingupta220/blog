Just imagine a day when you have to live without oxygen. Now you all just thought how could we survive without oxygen. Yeah, you are thinking right no one can survive even a single minute without oxygen. But if we need oxygen to survive, oxygen also needs trees and plants to survive. I know this is something tricky but all I want to say that if there is no plants and trees there is no oxygen also.

Plants and trees exhale oxygen and inhale carbon dioxide. But imagine one day there is no trees in this world then how do you get oxygen? Now you have to think seriously because it is a sensitive matter. Many people cut down trees for their purpose like they have to build some building there or they want the land to make new house and much more. By this, the count of trees reduces and it affects our climate and leads to **Global Warming**.

Now we first understand what Global warming is? In simple language, Global Warming occurs when the amount of carbon dioxide increase in our atmosphere and it affects our ozone layer and create a hole in it and by this hole, the harmful rays of sun come directly to earth and melt our glaciers. When the glacier melts the amount of water in rivers and seas increases and we all go underwater. Wow, It is really cool when we live underwater. Jokes apart but it is really serious matter. We have to think about it.

So the solution of this is we just have to plant trees. It looks very easy that we only have to plant trees it’s not a big deal. And after reading this you have full of energy, now you plant trees everywhere. But how much trees you plant? One, two, three or maybe ten. Boss but we need plenty of trees. Maybe 10,000 or 1,00,000. But now you think how one man can plant so many trees? Boss, there is a man who plants a whole forest of more than 1300 acres. Just imagine a man plants a whole forest. How could he do that? Is this real or just a story? Hold on guys, hold on I have all the answers for your thoughts and questions.   
Yeah, there’s a man named **Jadav Payeng**, known as the forest man of India who created a forest in Assam, single-handedly. He plants trees for the past 35 years. The forest is full of trees as well as many animals like Elephant, Rhinos, Tigers and many more.

But now the question is why is he doing this? No, he is not doing for his own wellness but for our society and for environment. He said that now politics becomes a business and no one cares for the environment but someone has to take the initiative. So why should not me?

His words are very precious, it changed my view. It is appreciable how he single handedly planted a forest. I plant only two or three plants and I was like how big thing I was done. And one thing I forget to tell you, he is a Padma awardee also. Isn’t it very cool thing? Yeah, it is. But now for sure I took environment seriously and plants as much as trees I can.
