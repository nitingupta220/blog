> When you hear the word **‘Superhero’** which is the first name comes in your mind. In my mind, the only word came is “Superman”. You have watched many superheroes movies like Superman, Batman, Spiderman and much more.   
> Have you heard about any Indian superhero? I think the answer is No. I even can’t hear about any Indian superhero. But is there any possibility that they exist? Yeah, I also not sure about it.  
> But let me tell you that they actually exist. There is an organization which is silently working to protect us is the **Indian Army**.  
> They have shown once again that they are always there for the people as they went beyond their call of duty to rescue nine people including a pregnant woman, who were stranded in an ambulance at Nastachung Pass, Kupwara District of Jammu and Kashmir.  
> An ambulance which carries nine people including one pregnant lady and a 15-year-old boy who is under observation were stranded in Nastachung Pass due to landslide.   
> The team not only cleared the way for Ambulance but also give medical relief to the patients.  
> I salute the Indian Army for their works and keeps helping and rescuing in every situation. Be it snow, fire, air, water Indian Army is always there to save us.
