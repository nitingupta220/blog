You heard many cases about a man who throws acid on the face of a girl and pressurize to marry him. And we all think that there is always the boy’s mistake that he couldn’t understand that a girl doesn’t like him and don’t want to marry him.  
 But have you heard that a girl pressurize a boy to marry her and when he rejects the proposal she actually tries to kill him and throws acid on his face.  
This looks weird thing that how can a woman throws acid on to a man. But let me tell you that there is a case in Bengaluru, where a woman wants to marry a man and the man rejects her, she wanted to kill him and for this, she throws acid on him.   
**Lidiya**, working as a nurse in a private hospital loves **Jayakumar**, but they are from different castes. So they both agreed to separate but Lidiya doesn’t want to breakup. And she always tried to convince him for marriage but Jayakumar doesn’t want to get into a relationship again. When Lidiya founds that Jayakumar was going to marry another woman, she was very upset and want to kill Jayakumar.  
So she makes a plan for this and one day she follows Jayakumar, and she is waiting at a corner of a road for Jayakumar, who is coming with his brother from a temple. When he slowed down to take a turn, she threw acid on his face.  
Despite the burning face, Jayakumar chased her and at a point, he caught the killer. He wants to know who the person is and when he takes away the helmet that Lidiya wore, she attacks him with a surgical knife. But Jayakumar and his brother caught him and hand her over to the police.
