If you have a 14yr child so what would be your dreams related to his future? Hope you want him to become a doctor, an engineer or something else. But have you think that at this age your son owns a company. You thought that what rubbish I am talking. Yes, you heard right there is a child who owns a company and recently signs a deal worth 5cr. **Harshawardhan Zala**, a 14yr old boy from Gujarat signs a deal with Gujarat Government worth Rs.5cr. He works on a project for the production of drones that helps in detected landmines in the war field. The idea of this drone comes after he saw on television that many soldiers died because of landmines blasts while defusing them manually. He already built three drones. The drones have equipped with infrared, RGB sensor along with a 21-megapixel camera. His company named ‘Aerobotics’. He has lots of plans for the future. He has an inspiration for many peoples who thought that they can’t do anything. Imagine when a boy this age could do this much for the country then how much we support our country.
