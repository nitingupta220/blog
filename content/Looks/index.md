Looks 

What did you call a man who is wearing a Kurta, driving a cycle and lived in a tribal area? I read about a man who is like I describe but I am shocked to know the reality. He has a degree from IIT Delhi, a Masters degree and a Ph.D. from Houston. His story is a true inspiration for me. If you want to do some for the society you will have many ways to do it. Alok Sagar, ex-IIT professor has been living in a remote village of Madhya Pradesh for past 32 years and serving the people. While teaching in IIT he makes many bright students and Raghuram Rajan, the ex-RBI governor is one of them. After resigning from IIT he moves to a village where there is lacking of electricity and roads. He believes that a man who wants to help the society he has to work on the grassroots level. He living a very simple life. During election time in his village where he lived many people questions his identity and asked him to leave. Then he revealed his long list of achievements which surprised all the villagers.  
His simplicity is making his story truly inspiring. I also very inspired with this man.
