You all heard the proverb that “**Padhoge likhoge to banoge nawab, kheloge kudoge to banoge kharab**” (You will be a King if you read and write, and be spoilt if you play games). According to our society, this is always right. Because our society always thinks that if you want to be successful in your life the only way for that is to study. If you don’t study then you will not become successful or you can’t achieve anything in your life. But this seems to be proven wrong many times because many of the people were doing invincible in this world maybe they studied much but they are great persons and doing great in their fields.   
Like that there is an organization that challenges this norm. In India, it is a challenge to run a Play based program but running it successfully over 4 years with more than 2500 children is really amazing.   
**Akshai Abraham**, a common man from Lucknow observes this thing that in our society people always want their children to study and they thought that if they don’t study their children want to be successful.   
So for this, he started a project name “**KHEL**” (Kids Holistic Education and Lifeskills). He merges his interest in sports and social work to change the society. This project is all about that every person takes his best out of them by playing games. But to start this program in **Uttar Pradesh** is really a tough job. Because there is a lack of passionate people who work with good ethics. And in India, the image of an **NGO** is not so good. So to start this program he faces many difficulties like he goes to each and every person and shares his ideas but many of them refuse but he didn’t let down his hopes and keeps on trying. First, when he start this program the main problem is how to get funds. So in starting, he launched the programs with their own funds. But now there is no problem of funds, they have sufficient funds. Project KHEL was first started at 3 locations with 100 children and within the 3 years, this counting reaches to 12000 children. Now this project is working very fine in many parts of the country. They have many workshops on the topics such as Child sexual abuse, teen issues and much more. It is a unique program which helps children from disadvantaged backgrounds grow into responsible and contributing members of society.   
He works very well for the society and he hopes that his project “KHEL” grows into an organization who help many children across the country each and every day. I also appreciate his approach.
