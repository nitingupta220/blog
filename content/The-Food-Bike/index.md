Imagine you have a **Royal Enfield Bike**, what did you do with that?  
If I have one I used it to show off. But have you heard that anyone use it to selling food street to street. Yeah, you heard right that there are two brothers who convert a Royal Enfield Bike into food selling bike. **Arun** and **Krishna** both redesigned a bike into a BBQ ride. They fit a sidecar in a Royal Enfiled and converted it into a mobile Barbeque grill which they used in for their street food idea. They both already owns a food truck business but there is parking problem in it. And the idea of the two-wheeler mobile business came from there. They want to convert 150 bikes in near future. The brothers have grabbed the attention of everyone from movie producers to investors. Once parked, it all can ten minutes to start. All he need open the sidecar and top of the grill come in the view. As they offer only continental food and want to provide non-veg and veg food at the same time. But they have not enough money to afford two bikes at the same time on the same spot. They want to take their business at all over India, as they have inquiries for the franchise from many places in India as well as Dubai also. They started a company called BBQ ride India. Now they are paying attention to product quality and standardization of food; they use good quality oils, spices and other quality stuff.  
There initiative is very good and it surely has a helping hand for those people who have stayed on rent.
