Just think that when you were 4 years old what are the things you can do at that time?  
Most of the children just started going to school and few of them know how to read and write.  
But at this age, you think that anyone can read more than 1000 books.  
Okay at first you thought reading books at this age is fine anyone can do it but 1000 books that are really unusual.  
Now you immediately thought that what rubbish I am talking.  
But boss, I tell you that there is a girl named Daliyah who read more than 1000 books and she is just 4 years old.  
I couldn’t read that much books in my entire life.  
But for Daliyah, this is just a normal day at the office.  
She is reading books like a printer scans a paper.  
She is skilled in reading and is very passionate about literature.  
Impressed by her, the librarian of the library of Congress granting her as the Librarian of the day.  
The interest of reading books came from just before she was born.   
Before his birth, her mother usually read stories to her elder brothers and sisters and when she was just 18 years old she started recognizing the words that her mother read to her.  
And then she is reading books regularly. Her mother counts that how much books she reads till now. And now when she was 4 years old, she reads more than 1000 books.  
She doesn’t want to stop now and want to read 1500 books by the age of 5.  
Hope she fulfill her dream.
