You see many politicians in your life. Some of them are doing good for the society and some just fill their pockets with the money of public. But you never see a politician who is so poor that he even can’t buy a house for him. It sounds very unusual that when I tell you I know a person who was a politician once and now he has not a proper house to live. You thought what rubbish I am talking, neither of the politicians has such conditions. It’s not your fault you always read about the politicians who are doing scams and all. But boss let me tell you an interesting story of a great politician who always wants to help the people and even now he helps them when he is too old.   
**Jamuna Prasad ‘Bose**’, an **ex-MLA** and a two-time minister who lives in a two-room house which is in a very weak condition. After you read the name you might think that ‘Bose’ is just a normal surname. But it is not his actual surname, this is the title that is given to him by the people after his struggles for the rights of poor. He is a very great person. First, he contested in elections in 1962 but sadly he fails but he doesn’t let the hopes down. And finally in 1974, he becomes the MLA, and in 1977 he becomes a minister after winning the assembly poll. He always ready to help the peoples. He always thinks for the society first and the prove of this is that after so many years he can’t have a house of his own. He lives in a rented house. Half of his pension goes to buy his medicines, and the remaining goes towards household expenditure and rent. His all family members want him to this and that, but every time he just smiles and says that he has no regrets. At present, he is 92 years old, and still, he is always ready to help anyone. This helping nature of him is appreciated by everyone. I wish that he lives happily.
