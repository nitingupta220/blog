You always heard that proverb **“Behind every successful man, there’s a woman”.** And it is true, you heard many stories when a woman helps a man indirectly. I also believe that this is right but never heard or see a real life story about that. But when I read the story of how three women help us to reach on Mars I was totally amazed. This time you thought that what I am talking about? How can I woman help us to reach on Mars? Is she push us to the Mars? There are many questions in your mind that you wanted to know the answers. So let me you tell you the whole story.   
You knew that India’s first mission to reach on Mars is successful in the first attempt. But how many of you know that there are three women behind the success of that mission. I thought that none of you know that fact. I also don’t know that thing before I read about it.  
**The Mars Orbiter Mission** (MOM) is India’s first interplanetary mission. Also known as **Mangalyaan**, the MOM made India, the first country that reaches on Mars in its first attempt. There are many peoples that are behind this success. But especially I wanted to tell you about three women scientists who are behind this mission.   
The scientists are **Seetha Somasundaram**, **Nandini Harinath**, and **Minal Rohi**t.  
All these three women did very hard work for this mission. They all spend hours in the office for the mission. They work for hours and those hours are full of excitement and tension. They all put their best in for that. There determination and hard work gives the country pride.  
After reading their stories one thing I must say that “ **Aaj ki Naari sab par bhaari**”.
