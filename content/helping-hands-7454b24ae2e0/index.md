“Helping hands”

Today i read about two peoples.

First is Vivek sharma, the man who lost his son due to some undiagnosed medical condition. He observe that people who suffers from any big diseases, is found difficult to get a perfect partner to get married. So he started a website named Divine Relations who help those peoples to get a suitable life partner. He also started the Mickey Amogh foundation who named after his late son Amogh and his friend’s son Mickey who both dies due to any medical condition. They started the foundation on 4th nov(Amogh’s birthday). He also quits his job to help others. His foundation has just started and the platform has not seen any matchmaking stories but Vivek is sure that it will happen soon.

The other one is Ganpat krishna from Rajasthan. The man whose vision is to help beggars to turn into farmers and lived their life independently. Ganpat krishna is a well educated man with engineering degree. His was from a poor family and they all are dependent on the ancestal land. In childhood he heard his uncle and father that they were in a big trouble due to shortage of rain and they all invest their whole money into a tubewell but the project has failed. So his family were force to migrate to cities and work as labours for their earnings. That time the idea for helping beggars to turn into farmers came in the mind of ganpat krishna. He started studying hard and educated well. He graduated with engineer degree in 2014 and want to help peoples but he has a education loan to repay. So he started to work in a company but later he work on the project of turning beggars into farmers and collabrate with a company who thought that it is a good idea. But in starting it is difficult to convince beggars to take participate but later some beggars understand his thoughts and join him in the initiative. And now he has a team of 100 beggars who work in his organic farm. His initiative is for a noble cause.

I hope they both succedd in whatever initiatives they work on.
